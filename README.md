# 🔧 Advanced Bubble Sort Toolkit in C

A modern, pointer-centric implementation of **Bubble Sort** in C designed for deep learning, performance experiments, and showcasing recursive and iterative techniques — all wrapped with dynamic memory, XOR swapping, and advanced function pointer mechanics.

---

##  Highlights

- 📌 **Two sorting variants**:
  - ✅ Recursive Bubble Sort (pointer-based)
  - ✅ Iterative Bubble Sort (pointer-based)
- 🎯 In-place mutation, zero-copy sorting
- 💾 Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- 🔀 XOR-based swap logic (no temp variables)
- 🧠 Uses function pointers and pointer-to-array returns
- 🧪 Designed for understanding recursion, ternary logic, and pointer arithmetic in C
